				<hr/>
				<p>Last time, when I finished my LCD intro project: StatTrak LCD, I told myself I would use a 
				photo-resistor / sensor in this project. And I learned about how to use it and I did.</p>
				<p>Basically a photo-sensor looks like a resistor, and it has two ends, also like a resistor. 
				One end is for power, adding a resistor between the power and the photo-sensor pin adjusts the sensitivity 
				which it will capture light. The other end of the photo-sensor is connected to the analog input pins 
				on the Arduino. It must be analog and not digital since the photo-sensor outputs an analog signal between 0 and 
				1023 in the Arduino programs depends on the light intensity. </p>

				<p> The official Arduino's website also has some great resources on learning different components and parts. 
				Things like the photo-sensor.</p>
				<p> One thing I personally think is really important when it comes to wiring things up is how COMPACT and EFFICIENT 
				it is. In this version of my traffic lights (I'm going to be doing more variation of traffic lights in the near future), 
				I have two sets of lights, each consists of red, yellow and green. The two sets are placed opposite of each other 
				along the same road, similar to something like this: </p>
				<center><img src = "img/traffic_1.png" width = 30% /></center>
				<p> Because the two sets of traffic lights are across each other and controlling the same road of traffic, I can 
				simplify the pin usage by connecting the similar signals. I connected green of one side to green on the other side, 
				likewise with other colours. This reduced Arduino used pins down from 7 pins 
				(6 digital outputs for the 6 LEDs + 1 analog input) to only 4 pins (3 pairs of LEDs + 1 analog input). </p>
				<p> By reducing the pins used, it also gives me a benefit in programming. Because now, I only need to control 3 outputs. </p>
