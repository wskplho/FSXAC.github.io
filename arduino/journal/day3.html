				<hr/>
				<p>Last time, when I finished my LCD intro project: StatTrak LCD, I told myself I would use a 
				photo-resistor / sensor in this project. And I learned about how to use it and I did.</p>
				<p>Basically a photo-sensor looks like a resistor, and it has two ends, also like a resistor. 
				One end is for power, adding a resistor between the power and the photo-sensor pin adjusts the sensitivity 
				which it will capture light. The other end of the photo-sensor is connected to the analog input pins 
				on the Arduino. It must be analog and not digital since the photo-sensor outputs an analog signal between 0 and 
				1023 in the Arduino programs depends on the light intensity. </p>

				<hr/>
				<p> The official Arduino's website also has some great resources on learning different components and parts. 
				Things like the photo-sensor.</p>
				<p> One thing I personally think is really important when it comes to wiring things up is how COMPACT and EFFICIENT 
				it is. In this version of my traffic lights (I'm going to be doing more variation of traffic lights in the near future), 
				I have two sets of lights, each consists of red, yellow and green. The two sets are placed opposite of each other 
				along the same road, similar to something like this: </p>
				<center><img src = "img/traffic_1.png" width = 30% /></center>
				<p> Because the two sets of traffic lights are across each other and controlling the same road of traffic, I can 
				simplify the pin usage by connecting the similar signals. I connected green of one side to green on the other side, 
				likewise with other colours. This reduced Arduino used pins down from 7 pins 
				(6 digital outputs for the 6 LEDs + 1 analog input) to only 4 pins (3 pairs of LEDs + 1 analog input). </p>
				<p> By reducing the pins used, it also gives me a benefit in programming. Because now, I only need to control 3 outputs. </p>

				<p>CONSTRUCTION COMPLETE!</p>

				<p>Now it's up to finish coding. It's not too hard, but I get alot of confusions in the <code>void loop()</code>
				function because the function itself is looped, and I constantly forget that simply because it looks like a 
				stand-alone function.</p>

				<p> After countless trials, debugging, fixing, waiting, testing... The code is finally finished for this first project 
				of traffic lights. Here it is below: </p>
				<pre><code>
/* 
// ==variables==
// pins
int red = 2;
int yellow = 3;
int green = 4;
int light = A5;

// light
int lightLevel = 0;
int lightInput;
int lightRestriction = 100;

// time
int yellowTime = 3000;
int redTime = 20000;

// ==bare minimums==
void setup() {
	// setup operations that only run once
	pinMode(red, OUTPUT);
	pinMode(yellow, OUTPUT);
	pinMode(green, OUTPUT);
	
	// serial
	Serial.begin(9600);
	
	// calibrates the light sensor for 2 seconds
	for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
		// take the average light level
		int newLightLevel = analogRead(light);
		lightLevel = (lightLevel + newLightLevel) / 2;
		delay(40);
		
		Serial.println("Calibrating Light Sensor: " + lightLevel.toString());
	}
	Serial.println("Light Sensor Calibrated: " + 
}

void loop() {
	lightInput = analogRead(light);
	
	// without signals, green light is always on
	digitalWrite(green, HIGH);
	
	if (lightInput < (lightLevel - lightRestriction)) {
		stopLight();
	}
}

// ==called when photocell senses shadow==
void stopLight() {
	// yellow light
	digitalWrite(green, LOW);
	digitalWrite(yellow, HIGH);
	delay(yellowTime);
	
	// red light
	digitalWrite(yellow, LOW);
	digitalWrite(red, HIGH);
	delay(redTime);
	
	// turn the red light off and go back to green
	digitalWrite(red, LOW);
}
