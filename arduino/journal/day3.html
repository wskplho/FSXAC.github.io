				<hr/>
				<p>Last time, when I finished my LCD intro project: StatTrak LCD, I told myself I would use a 
				photo-resistor / sensor in this project. And I learned about how to use it and I did.</p>
				<p>Basically a photo-sensor looks like a resistor, and it has two ends, also like a resistor. 
				One end is for power, adding a resistor between the power and the photo-sensor pin adjusts the sensitivity 
				which it will capture light. The other end of the photo-sensor is connected to the analog input pins 
				on the Arduino. It must be analog and not digital since the photo-sensor outputs an analog signal between 0 and 
				1023 in the Arduino programs depends on the light intensity. </p>
