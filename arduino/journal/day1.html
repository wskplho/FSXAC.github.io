				<p>I got the EMF detector (theremin) slightly working. By that, I mean not working at all because the output is unpredictable. </p>
				<p>Some times it works fine, it makes a noise when it's close to a strong EMF source such as a power outlet. But other times it just picks up random signal and I have yet to figure out what it is.</p>
				<p>I have consulted local experts. They explained: one of the possibility that causes the randomness is the objects around the theremin may act like a capacity which it will 
				induce a current, therefore creating unwanted inputs. Another hypothesis suggets that the theremin is picking up radio waves (radio, WiFi, or any other similar waves)</p>
				<p>How did I make it?</p>
				<p>For inputs, I have a "probe", which is a long solid-core insulated copper wire (about 15cm long) attached to analog pin A5. 
				I also have a 10MΩ resistor with one side connected to the probe and the other side connected to GND (ground)</p>
				<p>For outputs, I have an LED as well as a speaker wired up to digital pin D11 and GND. In the middle is a 220Ω resistor. </p>
				<p>The Arduino takes analog input from the probe and compares it with a set number, this number can be set to change the offset of sensitivity. The comparison then makes the LED and the speaker turn on and off.</p>

				<p>I started a new project. The Project 02 from the official project book. Because I only have one set of Arduino, it means that I'll have to the theremin apart.
				But oh well. It wasn't good anyway. Once I have gathered more knowledge about circuitry and Arduino projects in general, perhaps I can build a better one with more predictable results.</p>
				<p>At this point in time, I have become more adapted to reading electric / circuit diagrams. Instead of looking and following the pictures in the book, I can just place the components and visualize 
				how it will all flow out in my head. I also learned about buttons and how they should be placed, well, at least for the very basic button included in the kit. </p>

				<p>Some small inconvenience: I didn't want to use the pre-made jumper wires came in the kit because, I don't know, I feel cheap?</p>
				<p>Anyway, what I use for wiring things up is my own bundle of wires, but then I'll have to cut them and strip them. And since I don't own a wire stripper, I have to strip them using scissors which is painfully frustrating.</p>
				<p>Until I have more wire supplies, I guess I'll  to keep doing these infuriating work.</p>

				<p>Phew! Just finished Project 02. It didn't take a lot of time, but still fun.</p>
				<p>This is only the stuff showed in the book, I have not added or modified anything at the time because I still need to analyse the code to see how it works. But it should not be too hard</p>
				<p>I also recorded a video of the project in action along with voice explanation of the circuitry.</p>
				<p>I am planning on expanding this project, probably more LEDs. I was thinking somewhere in vicinity of 10 or more LEDs where the project only has 3. This will both let me develop further understanding on
				Arduino programming as well as circuitry skills. (More electronic components on a fixed size of breadboard means I need to be more compact with my wiring)</p>

				<p>So I am learning a lot right now, especially the software side of the Arduino. 
				Just things such as syntax for doing things.</p>
				<p>For instance, I learned how to make a <u>constant</u> in Arduino by just appending 
				<code class = "Single">const</code> in front of the variable declaration.</p>
				<p>I also learned how to use <u>for loops</u> in Arduino's programming language. 
				It's actually the same as Java, and just as identical as Javascript. This is how you make 
				a <u>for loop</u>:</p>
				<pre><code>
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	// execution code here
}
				</code></pre>
				<p>Now that I know <u>for loops</u>, instead of writing out all the code to open up
				some new pins to output line by line:</p>
				<pre><code>
pinMode(1, OUTPUT);
pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
pinMode(3, OUTPUT);
pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
pinMode(5, OUTPUT);
pinMode(6, OUTPUT);
pinMode(7, OUTPUT);
pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
				</code></pre>
				<p>This is what I will do from now on:</p>
				<pre><code>
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
	pinMode(i, OUTPUT);
}	
				</code></pre>
				<p>Saves a lot of time and effort.</p>

				<p>Did you know Arduino IDE has a console? WHAT!?</p>
				<p>That's right, it is called a <u>Serial</u>. And it is used for debugging 
				as well as communicating from Arduino to the user since there is no built in console 
				screen on the Arduino itself.</p>
				<p>To initiate the <u>Serial</u>, simply type in <code class = "Single">
				Serial.open(9600);</code> into the <code class = "Single">void setup()</code> function. 
				And that will open up a serial port between the computer and the Arduino at the communication 
				speed of 9600 bits per second.</p>
				<p>At the time I still have not played too much with the <u>Serial</u> yet but I know that 
				it is also possible to print out stuff like strings or any other kind of information. And this 
				is done by using the <code class = "Single">Serial.print(msg);</code> function where 
				<code class = "Single">msg</code> is the output.</p>
