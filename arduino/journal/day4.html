				No actual explosive is produced throughout this project. The word "bomb" is in quotation marks because 
				it is not an actual explosive but rather just some flashing LEDs. </i></p>
				<p> I am going to start a new project; this time it is going to include a small speaker and, hopefully, 
				the LCD in combination.</p>
				<p> Once again, this is based on the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive like the last project. (<a 
				href = "day2.html" style = "font-size: 16px;">StatTrak LCD Project</a>) This is the "bomb" terrorists carry 
				in the game. </p>
				<p> How it works in the game: <br/>
				> The Terrorists take 4 seconds to enters the code "7355608" to plant the "bomb". <br/>
				> The "bomb" will have have 45 seconds of countdown before it explodes. <br/>
				> Counter-Terrorists take 10 seconds to defuse the "bomb", and 5 seconds if they have defuse-kits. <br/>
				> If the CTs do not manage to finish defusing in 45 seconds, the "bomb" will explode. <br/>
				</p>
				<p> The sound of the "bomb": <br/>
				> When the "bomb" is planted, it makes a beep every second. But as the time counts down, 
				the "bomb" will beep faster and faster. <br/>
				> At the last second before the "bomb" explodes, a chirp sound followed by rapid beeps initiates the "explosion". <br/>
				> "Terrorists Win!"

				<p>Initially, I only have a speaker and LED hooked up to the Arduino so it could make a noise and a flash as the "bomb" 
				counts down. Very simple, Code below (very messy):</p>
				<pre><code><xmp>
// LCD library
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>

// creating an LCD object with pins as arguments
LiquidCrystal lcd(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7);

int timeDelay = 1000;
int seconds = 0;
int newSeconds = 0;

String exploded = "not";
int startTime = millis();

int explodeTone = 2834;
int explodeToneRate = 144;

int armIteration = 0;
int armTone = 3520;
int armLength = 35;
int armDelay = 90;

void setup() {
	// put your setup code here, to run once:
	pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
	pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
	Serial.begin(9600);
	lcd.begin(16, 2);
}

void loop() {
	// if the bomb hasn't exploded, keep counting
	if (exploded == "not") {
		newSeconds = millis() / 1000;
		digitalWrite(9, HIGH);
		if (newSeconds != seconds) {
			timeDelay = timeDelay - 20;
			seconds = newSeconds;
		}

		tone(8, 4000, 100);
		delay(timeDelay);

		startTime = millis();

		if (timeDelay < 110) {
			delay(100);
			exploded = "armed";
		}
	} 
	else if (exploded == "armed") {
		arm();
		explode();
		exploded = "exploding";
	} 
	else {
		delay(10000);
	}
}

// make the chirp sound
void arm() {
	for (int i = 0; i < 50; i ++) {
		explodeTone = explodeTone + explodeToneRate;
		tone(8, explodeTone, 50);
		delay(20);
	} 
}

// make the explosion tone
void explode() {
	for (int i = 0; i < 12; i ++) {
		tone(8, armTone, armLength);
		delay(armDelay);
		armIteration ++;
	} 
}							
				</xmp></code></pre>
				<p>But this is not good enough. <br/>
				First, the "bomb" is not authentic enough. It is still missing elements. Second, the code is not very 
				good, it is extremely messy as well as inefficient. So I'm planning to re-write the code.</p>
