				No actual explosive is produced throughout this project. The word "bomb" is in quotation marks because 
				it is not an actual explosive but rather just some flashing LEDs. </i></p>
				<p> I am going to start a new project; this time it is going to include a small speaker and, hopefully, 
				the LCD in combination.</p>
				<p> Once again, this is based on the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive like the last project. (<a 
				href = "day2.html" style = "font-size: 16px;">StatTrak LCD Project</a>) This is the "bomb" terrorists carry 
				in the game. </p>
				<p> How it works in the game: <br/>
				> The Terrorists take 4 seconds to enters the code "7355608" to plant the "bomb". <br/>
				> The "bomb" will have have 45 seconds of countdown before it explodes. <br/>
				> Counter-Terrorists take 10 seconds to defuse the "bomb", and 5 seconds if they have defuse-kits. <br/>
				> If the CTs do not manage to finish defusing in 45 seconds, the "bomb" will explode. <br/>
				</p>
				<p> The sound of the "bomb": <br/>
				> When the "bomb" is planted, it makes a beep every second. But as the time counts down, 
				the "bomb" will beep faster and faster. <br/>
				> At the last second before the "bomb" explodes, a chirp sound followed by rapid beeps initiates the "explosion". <br/>
				> "Terrorists Win!"
